[D Guide to Midsummer Festival Fires in Outland]

[OC]As I play Alliance, I might have missed some optimizations of the routes for Horde. Please suggest improvements via Curse or Github! You may of course take different routes and use this guide to see if you missed any Fires.

[OC]Please note that you will be flagged for PvP when desecrating an enemy fire.

[OC]Now let's get started! We'll start in Shattrath and move counter-clockwise. If you have fast flying, just beeline it. If not, use the taxi gryphon/windriders.

[OC]With fast flying, this guide takes about 17min.

[OC]Portal to Shattrath.
