[D Guide to Midsummer Festival Fires in Kalimdor]

[OC]As I play Alliance, I might have missed some optimizations of the routes for Horde. Please suggest improvements via Curse or Github! You may of course take different routes and use this guide to see if you missed any Fires.

[OC]Please note that you will be flagged for PvP when desecrating a fire (or entering a enemy capital city).

[OC]Now let's get started! We'll work our way from the North downwards.
